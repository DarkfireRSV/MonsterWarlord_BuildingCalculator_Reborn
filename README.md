# MonsterWarlord_BuildingCalculator_Reborn
This is a Calculator for buildings in Monster Warlord. Its a program that was lost because gamevil deleted its forums.
I am merely repost this because the original post has died. It has all buildings.

His words:

Hello MW Community,

i used the last days to create a little something, that i thought would be quite useful for a lot of players.

A few brief notes before we get started

- This is NOT a Hack for Jewels or anything else
- It is a program and you will have to download it in order to use it
- I do not own any of the graphics, used in the program. The right for those are owned by Gamevil
- This program is for private use only!
- You may share this program, as long as you are not earning any money with it


Ok, lets get to it.

First things first. Here is the downloadlink. -> https://mega.co.nz/#!V9xEXQiB!srHXnaZU8tXPD4ObRUzGwLLtNUwYVjy5PsuLDrWpIyE

I will post a little "Tutorial" with pictures below, but let me tell you what exactly this is, first.

This is a program, which calculates the efficiency of the buildings you have and then tells you what would be the best(most efficient) purchase in your situation.
I did find something like that as an app for android, but at lot of the reviews said, that it would be inacurate or not really trustworthy, so i thought: why not make my own litte program.
My program has two general functions:

1. create and edit profiles of which, and how many buildings you own
2. calculate what buildings to buy with a given amount of gold

And that's it. Simple and plain as that.

Lets get to the tutorial part of this thread:

What you will find on your computer after you clicked on the downloadlink above, is a file called: MWBC.rar

What you want to do is, to unpack this container with the program of your choice(for me this is WinRar).

After unpacking, there should be a folder, called: "MWBC", containing the following three things:
- an empty folder called: "Profiles",
- a .exe file called: "Monster Warlord Building Calculator"
- and a file called: "settings.dat".

Both things, the empty folder and the settings file, can be deleted, but be aware, that the program will recreate both of those upon start.

Usually, the Profiles folder will contain your created profiles, which are also .dat files.
